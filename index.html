<h1> Tag Testing </h1> 
<p> Hey All! This is a dummy website created to test analytic tags. </p>
<p> The first push / commit to this has been successful. Next steps would involve implementing google analytic tags on this and to see if they are firing correctly. </p>
<p>This is now a version installed with the Google Analytics Tag. Need to wait for 48 hours for it to collect data and reflect it on the Google Analytics Dashboard </p>
